/**
 * <p>
 * A servlet Filter that can be used as alternative for {@link EagerBeansWebListener}.
 * <p>
 * This instantiates eager request scoped beans during request processing at the point where this filter
 * is inserted in the chain.
 * <p>
 * This is needed for those situations where the CDI request scope is NOT available in a {@link ServletRequestListener},
 * such as is the case for GlassFish 3 (note that this is not spec compliant, CDI request scope should be available) and where
 * session scoped beans cannot be instantiated from an {@link HttpSessionListener} such as is the case for GlassFish 3 again.
 * <p>
 * If this Filter is installed {@link EagerBeansWebListener} main function (instantiating request and session scoped
 * beans) will be automatically disabled.
 * <p>
 * Naturally this filter should not be enabled for environments where CDI is not available at all.
